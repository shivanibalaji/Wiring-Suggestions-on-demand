# Wiring-Suggestions-on-demand

TASK-4
Consider a Temperature sensor, an analog device having 3 pins, i.e., VCC, GND, and analog output. When the user drags-and-drops on the schematic, the system should automatically suggest connecting to appropriate pins of Arduino, i.e., to VCC, GND, and one of the analog pins of Arduino, respectively. Design and implement such functionality such that the user experience is enhanced while designing. This can be implemented as a rule-driven mechanism.

                   Here is the short video of stimulating the arduino to the temparature sensor

1) The approach to stimulate the arduino is by DOCKER open source software and linux based command prompt

2) After installing the needs, want to link the git source file to the command prompt,it takes a while to install the dependencies

3) We want to call the main function to execute the arduino cloud to the web server,it has taked more time to install all the components and dependencies of arduino cloud

4) And want to include the other dependencies which we want to proceed with other components

5) after saving the file , want to wait for a while to  run and complete the task which we had executed

6) when we open it in the browser,we want to refresh the page and the window opens up

7) As we want to connect the temparature sensor ,we ewant arduino uno and temparature sensor

8) just drang the components to the working screen and connect the sensor to the following pins
1) Connect Arduino Uno GND to LM35 GND
2) Connect Arduino 5V pin to LM35 pin 1
3) Connect Arduino Uno Analog Pin 1 to LM35 pin OUT
9) save the project by the title .
